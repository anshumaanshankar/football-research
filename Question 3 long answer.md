I have chosen to compare Josh Allen against other quarterbacks in the NFL. For the 2023 season, I considered quarterbacks who played in at least half of the regular season, equating to 9 or more games, leaving 39 players for comparison. To evaluate them comprehensively, I ranked them based on eight key metrics: Passing Yards, Completion Percentage (Cmp%), Adjusted Net Yards per Attempt (ANY/A), Sacks (Sks), Game-Winning Drives (GWD), Fourth Quarter Comebacks (4QC), TD/INT Ratio, and Rushing Yards. Passing Yards and Cmp% measure a QB's ability to move the ball downfield accurately, while ANY/A reflects overall efficiency, factoring in critical play outcomes. Sacks indicate pressure handling, GWD and 4QC assess clutch performance, TD/INT Ratio evaluates decision-making, and Rushing Yards demonstrate the QBs ability in being multi-talented in moving the ball downfield. Given the insights from each of these metrics, I believe they collectively provide a well-rounded assessment of a quarterback's performance.

After ranking each quarterback on each metric, I calculated their average ranking across these metrics to identify which player had the lowest average rank. This analysis revealed that Josh Allen ranks first overall, aligning with the consensus that he is among the top 5, if not top 3 quarterbacks in the league. Despite his high performance, Allen is currently the 12th highest-paid quarterback. Notably, out of the 11 quarterbacks earning more, only Patrick Mahomes signed his existing contract before Allen (August 2021), with 8 of the remaining 10 signing within the last 15-18 months. This context highlights that Allen's current salary is more about timing than his ability or accomplishments, thereby addressing current opinions of articles calling him underpaid.

For finding their valuation, I am not considering career stats. This is becuase we have the QB drafting classes of 2020/21 earning more than elite QBs like Mahomes and Allen. These salaries are more a reflection of what is considered the current standard, more than being a result of experience. As a result of this, our modelling would not be accurate, and might project inaccurate salaries. Considering salaries against performance in the 2023 season, regression modelling gives Allen a valuation of $47.14 Million/Year. That being said, I value Josh Allen at $60 million per year, believing he should be above par compared to the earnings of quarterbacks like Jordan Love and Joe Burrow purely accounting for experience.

While calculating the average rank is insightful, using a weighted average might be more beneficial, as some metrics may hold more significance. Additionally, team dynamics can influence statistics, which should be considered in the evaluation process. While metrics like ESPN's Passer Rating, QBR, or Pro Football Focus (PFF) Grades could be included to rate QBs, I chose not to use them in conjunction with the chosen metrics. These metrics are often black boxes, and their underlying formulae are not transparent. Including them might double-count certain stats, swaying the modelling and contributing significantly to their ranking. When independently considered, Josh Allen ranks 3rd in QBR and this ties in well with our prediction of him being 1st this past season on performance.

## Question: What avenue of player acquisition do you think currently provides teams with the most value per dollar spend and why?

The method I used to evaluate a given player's ability in comparison to others in the same position was using a player's overall rating as given on Madden 23. This rating was divided by the log of their salary to give each player a value score. After grouping players by position and obtaining the top 3, it was seen that about 60% of these players signed as free agents, with drafted players being about 30%. This gives us a concise, quick way of what acquisition method provides the most value per dollar spend, as the ratings are good for comparision

However, Madden ratings are a reflection of past performance and do not account for injuries or estimate a player's growth/decline. For the same reason, rookies and players who have not had the chance to shine would not be ranked high. In order to overcome these issues, We can formulate a simple difference in Madden Rating and salary over consecutive years to determine whether a player's current value is on the rise or decline. For players who have had little or no NFL game time, college statistics can also be considered to highlight their potential. Alternate methods to compare players can involve other accurately created metrics like Pro Football Focus (PFF) ratings or to formulate our own Wins Above Replacements (WAR) metric like in baseball for these players. By using these methods or a combination of them we would be able to overcome the shortcomings of comparison via just Madden rankings.

## Question: What avenue of player acquisition do you think currently provides teams with the most value per dollar spend and why?

IDEA: To compare a player against others of the same position, we consider their 'overall_rating' and 'salary' as on Madden 23. Using these two metrics, I find the value of each person in a new column. Next, I group them by position, and for the top 5 persons in each position, find the associated acquisition type (drafted / traded / free agency). Using this, we can get a preliminary estimate on which player acquisition method works best.

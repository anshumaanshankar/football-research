### Question 1
The analysis reveals that free agents currently provide teams with the most value per dollar spent, followed by drafted players and trades. To evaluate a given player's ability in comparison to others in the same position, I used Madden 23 rankings to obtain an overall rating for each player. Additionally, I normalized player salaries to compress the range of values and calculated each player's 'value' as their rating divided by their normalized salary. Grouping players by position, I identified the top three players per position based on this value metric. Player's acquisition by their team (in that year) were added to this dataset at this point.

The findings showed an overwhelming majority of free agents, with drafted players being the second most common, followed by trades. To perform a more extensive analysis, we could leverage player stats grouped by position, create a model to identify the most significant metrics, and rank players using a formula based on these metrics. While more computationally intensive, it would provide a more comprehensive method of ranking a player against others in their position.

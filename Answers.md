### Question 1 - What avenue of player acquisition do you think currently provides teams with the most value per dollar spend and why?
The method I used to evaluate a given player's ability in comparison to others in the same position was using a player's overall rating as given on Madden 23. This rating was divided by the log of their salary to give each player a value score. After grouping players by position and obtaining the top 3, it was seen that about 60% of these players signed as free agents, with drafted players being about 30%. This gives us a concise, quick way of what acquisition method provides the most value per dollar spend, as the ratings are good for comparision

However, Madden ratings are a reflection of past performance and do not account for injuries or estimate a player's growth/decline. For the same reason, rookies and players who have not had the chance to shine would not be ranked high. In order to overcome these issues, We can formulate a simple difference in Madden Rating and salary over consecutive years to determine whether a player's current value is on the rise or decline. For players who have had little or no NFL game time, college statistics can also be considered to highlight their potential. Alternate methods to compare players can involve other accurately created metrics like Pro Football Focus (PFF) ratings or to formulate our own Wins Above Replacements (WAR) metric like in baseball for these players. By using these methods or a combination of them we would be able to overcome the shortcomings of comparison via just Madden rankings.

### Question 2 - Imagine that you are tasked with evaluating the accuracy of three different college-to-pro player projection systems for wide receivers. You have both the projections and actual pro statistics for the past 10 seasons. Discuss how you would approach the problem and list any potential issues you may encounter. 

From a player-performance standpoint, we can evaluate a system on how well it captures the correlation of key statistics with the outcome or by calculating error metrics such as MAE and RMSE between projection and actual statistics and viewing the distributions of those errors to spot patterns. When comparing algorithms, We can run many statistical tests that compare system accuracies, to arrive at conclusions about which system is better (if any). While this would work in comparing most projection systems, I believe we would not be accounting for all important factors needed in solving the problem at hand. 

I believe that projecting a player's future performance based on the past can be likened to stock value predictions. Just as a stock's value is dependent on the company's valuation and competition, a player's performance depends not only on them, but the atmosphere around them as well. This is exactly what the previously mentioned solution (and models) may fail to consider - factors like past injuries and the possibility of recurrence, whether the pro team's style of play would highlight the player's best skills, squad depth at the WR position on the pro team to name some. Specifically for wide receivers, We can also attest some importance on existing chemistry with the QB (For eg. Being from the same alma mater) and how that might heighten the WR's performance (Case in point: Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase). While some of these may not be typically captured or easily quantifiable metrics that affect the result in different ways, I believe that once the metrics have been well defined and adjusted based on feedback over time, these models would outperform their stats-only counterparts. 

### Question 3 - Choose any active player in the NFL. How do you assess the quality of this player relative to their position group, and why? How would you value this player in terms of dollars, and how does this compare to their current contract?

I have chosen to compare Josh Allen against other quarterbacks in the NFL. For the 2023 season, I considered quarterbacks who played in at least half of the regular season, equating to 8 or more games, leaving 39 players for comparison. To evaluate them comprehensively, I ranked them based on eight key metrics: Passing Yards, Completion Percentage (Cmp%), Adjusted Net Yards per Attempt (ANY/A), Sacks (Sks), Game-Winning Drives (GWD), Fourth Quarter Comebacks (4QC), TD/INT Ratio, and Rushing Yards. Passing Yards and Cmp% measure a QB's ability to move the ball downfield accurately, while ANY/A reflects overall efficiency, factoring in critical play outcomes. Sacks indicate pressure handling, GWD and 4QC assess clutch performance, TD/INT Ratio evaluates decision-making, and Rushing Yards demonstrate the QBs ability in being multi-talented in moving the ball downfield. Given the insights from each of these metrics, I believe they collectively provide a well-rounded assessment of a quarterback's performance. 

After ranking each quarterback on each metric, I calculated their average ranking across these metrics to identify which player had the lowest average rank. This analysis revealed that Josh Allen ranks second overall, aligning with the consensus that he is among the top 5, if not top 3 quarterbacks in the league. Despite his high performance, Allen is currently the 12th highest-paid quarterback. Notably, out of the 11 quarterbacks earning more, only Patrick Mahomes signed his existing contract before Allen (August 2021), with 8 of the remaining 10 signing within the last 15-18 months. This context highlights that Allen's current salary is more about timing than his ability or accomplishments, thereby addressing current opinions of articles calling him underpaid. 

That being said, I value Josh Allen at $55 million per year, believing he should be on par with the earnings of quarterbacks like Jordan Love and Joe Burrow, representing approximately 1.25 times his current annual salary of $43 million. For a quarterback of Mahomes' caliber, the valuation would be even higher, considering his recent achievements. While calculating the average rank is insightful, using a weighted average might be more beneficial, as some metrics may hold more significance. Additionally, team dynamics can influence statistics, which should be considered in the evaluation process. While metrics like ESPN's Passer Rating, QBR, or Pro Football Focus (PFF) Grades could be included to rate QBs, I chose not to use them in conjunction with the chosen metrics. These metrics are often black boxes, and their underlying formulae are not transparent. Including them might give a double advantage to players for whom an individual stat that influences these ratings highly already contributes significantly to their ranking, leading to skewed results. When independently considered, Josh Allen ranks 3rd in QBR. 

For finding their valuation, I am not considering career stats. This is becuase we have the QB drafting classes of 2020/21 earning more than elite QBs like Mahomes and Allen. These salaries are more a reflection of what is considered the current standard, more than being a result of experience. As a result of this, our modelling would not be accurate, and might project wildly inaccurate salaries. We are considering salaries relevant to the 2023 season, Giving Allen a valuation of $47.14 Million/Year

### Question 1 - What avenue of player acquisition do you think currently provides teams with the most value per dollar spend and why?
The method I used to evaluate a given player's ability in comparison to others in the same position was using a player's overall rating as given on Madden 23. This rating was divided by the log of their salary to give each player a value score. After grouping players by position and obtaining the top 3, it was seen that about 60% of these players signed as free agents, with drafted players being about 30%. This gives us a concise, quick way of what acquisition method provides the most value per dollar spend, as the ratings are good for comparision

However, Madden ratings are a reflection of past performance and do not account for injuries or estimate a player's growth/decline. For the same reason, rookies and players who have not had the chance to shine would not be ranked high. In order to overcome these issues, We can formulate a simple difference in Madden Rating and salary over consecutive years to determine whether a player's current value is on the rise or decline. For players who have had little or no NFL game time, college statistics can also be considered to highlight their potential. Alternate methods to compare players can involve other accurately created metrics like Pro Football Focus (PFF) ratings or to formulate our own Wins Above Replacements (WAR) metric like in baseball for these players. By using these methods or a combination of them we would be able to overcome the shortcomings of comparison via just Madden rankings.

### Question 2 - Imagine that you are tasked with evaluating the accuracy of three different college-to-pro player projection systems for wide receivers. You have both the projections and actual pro statistics for the past 10 seasons. Discuss how you would approach the problem and list any potential issues you may encounter. 

From a player-performance standpoint, we can evaluate a system on how well it captures the correlation of key statistics with the outcome or by calculating error metrics such as MAE and RMSE between projection and actual statistics and viewing the distributions of those errors to spot patterns. When comparing algorithms, We can run many statistical tests that compare system accuracies, to arrive at conclusions about which system is better (if any). While this would work in comparing most projection systems, I believe we would not be accounting for all important factors needed in solving the problem at hand. 

I believe that projecting a player's future performance based on the past can be likened to stock value predictions. Just as a stock's value is dependent on the company's valuation and competition, a player's performance depends not only on them, but the atmosphere around them as well. This is exactly what the previously mentioned solution (and models) may fail to consider - factors like past injuries and the possibility of recurrence, whether the pro team's style of play would highlight the player's best skills, squad depth at the WR position on the pro team to name some. Specifically for wide receivers, We can also attest some importance on existing chemistry with the QB (For eg. Being from the same alma mater) and how that might heighten the WR's performance (Case in point: Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase). While some of these may not be typically captured or easily quantifiable metrics that affect the result in different ways, I believe that once the metrics have been well defined and adjusted based on feedback over time, these models would outperform their stats-only counterparts.

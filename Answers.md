### Question 1 - What avenue of player acquisition do you think currently provides teams with the most value per dollar spend and why?
The method I used to evaluate a given player's ability in comparison to others in the same position was using a player's overall rating as given on Madden 23. This rating was divided by the log of their salary to give each player a value score. After grouping players by position and obtaining the top 3, it was seen that about 60% of these players signed as free agents, with drafted players being about 30%. This gives us a concise, quick way of what acquisition method provides the most value per dollar spend, as the ratings are good for comparision

However, Madden ratings are a reflection of past performance and do not account for injuries or games played in the season of consideration. In order to overcome this, We can formulate a simple difference in Madden Rating and salary over consecutive years to determine whether a player's current value is on an increasing or decreasing curve. Alternatively, borrowing from baseball, We can formulate a Wins above replacements (WAR) metric for these players to generate metrics that showcase their value in comparision to their counterparts.

### Question 2 - Imagine that you are tasked with evaluating the accuracy of three different college-to-pro player projection systems for wide receivers. You have both the projections and actual pro statistics for the past 10 seasons. Discuss how you would approach the problem and list any potential issues you may encounter.

To me, The effectiveness of a system is only partly attained by using pure game performance in its modeling for projections. Analogously, I believe that determining a player's future performance based on the past, is somewhat like stock predictions. Just as a stock's value is dependent on the company's valuation, I believe a player's performance depends not only on them, but the atmosphere around them. Let me explain - 

From a statistical standpoint, we could evaluate an algorithm by finding its error metrics between projection and actual statistics on key performance indicators for Wide Receivers and see what that error distribution shows us (Eg. Is there a systematic overestimation?). To compare these algorithms against one other, we could perform statistical tests such as t-tests, to see if one system has consistently lower error metrics than the others. This would tell us that a system was better than the others. What we fail to capture here, however, are things like long term injuries, A player's comfort level with their team and coaching staff, inconsistent game time and changing teams around a lot. Personally, I believe that these factors form very important pieces in determining a player's returns in terms of numbers and I believe that the best system would be ones that account for them. For example, If an algorithm determines its projections for a player by taking into account past injuries, correlates a player's playstyle in college with that of the pro team in question, that to me would be considered a better system than a system that does not account for these factors, even if the statistical tests and error metrics are not the best performing - assuming they perform adequately.

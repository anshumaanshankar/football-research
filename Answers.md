### Question 1 - What avenue of player acquisition do you think currently provides teams with the most value per dollar spend and why?
The method I used to evaluate a given player's ability in comparison to others in the same position was using a player's overall rating as given on Madden 23. This rating was divided by the log of their salary to give each player a value score. After grouping players by position and obtaining the top 3, it was seen that about 60% of these players signed as free agents, with drafted players being about 30%. This gives us a concise, quick way of gauging a player's value. 

However, Madden ratings are a reflection of past performance and do not account for injuries or games played in the season of consideration. In order to overcome this, We can formulate a simple difference in Madden Rating and salary over consecutive years to determine whether a player's current value is on an increasing or decreasing curve. Alternatively, formulating a Wins above replacements (WAR) metric for these players will give us insight on their performance as compared to their alternatives.

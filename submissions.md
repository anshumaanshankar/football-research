1. I used player's overall rating as given on Madden 23 to evaluate a player's value in comparison to others in the same position. This rating, divided by the log of their salary gives each player a value score. Observing the top 3 players per position, it was seen that 60% of these players signed as free agents and 30% were drafted. That is not hard to believe as hiring free agents means that teams acquire proven NFL talents without sacrificing draft picks or future assets, often at a lower cost than re-signing their own players. Additionally, it provides immediate roster improvements than grooming a rookie would and flexibility in addressing specific team needs.

Although the answer makes sense, Madden ratings may not be the best way to determine player value. Instead, we could consider changes in player ratings and salary over time to predict their upcoming value. For players with little or no NFL game time, college statistics are likely the best indicator of their potential. Alternative methods for comparing players could involve using other overall metrics like Pro Football Focus (PFF) ratings or formulating our own Wins Above Replacement (WAR) metric, similar to baseball. By using these methods or a combination of them, we can overcome the shortcomings of relying solely on Madden rankings.

2. To me, projecting a player's future performance based on the past is similar to predicting stock prices. Just as a stock's value depends on company valuation and competition, a player's performance relies not only on their abilities but also on the surrounding environment. Therefore, in my opinion, a model that incorporates rarely used metrics, such as past injuries and their recurrence risk, the team's style of play and its alignment with the player's strengths, the squad depth at wide receiver and the resulting play time for the rookie is better than one that does not. Specifically for wide receivers, existing chemistry with the quarterback—such as coming from the same alma mater like Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase—can positively impact performance and thus, should be included. While some of these factors are not easily quantifiable and affect results in various ways, integrating them once they are well defined will help these models outperform their stats-only counterparts.

That being said, we can always evaluate a system by how well it captures the correlation of key statistics with outcomes or by calculating error metrics such as MAE/RMSE between projections and actual numbers. When comparing algorithms, we can run multiple statistical tests to compare accuracies and determine which system is superior. While this approach can be effective, I lean towards models that also capture less mainstream statistics, provided they perform well on standard comparison measures.


3. I have chosen to compare Josh Allen against other NFL QBs. For the 2023 season, I considered QBs who played at least 8 games, leaving 39 for comparison. I ranked them based on eight key metrics: Passing and Rushing Yards, Completion %age, Adjusted Net Yards per Attempt, Sacks, Game-Winning Drives, 4th Quarter Comebacks, TD/INT Ratio - highlighting passing accuracy, efficiency, pressure handling, clutch performance, decision-making, and versatility, giving a comprehensive assessment.

After ranking each QB on these metrics, I calculated their average ranking. Allen ranked second overall, consistent with his reputation as a top-tier QB. Despite this, Allen is the 12th highest-paid QB. Only Mahomes signed his contract before Allen, with most of the other ten signing within the last 18 months, indicating that Allen's salary is more about timing than ability. I value Josh Allen at $55 million per year, on par with QBs like Jordan Love and Joe Burrow. This represents approximately 1.25 times his current annual salary of $43 million

While calculating the average rank is insightful, a weighted average might be more beneficial as some metrics may hold greater significance. Team dynamics can also influence statistics, which should be considered. Metrics like QBR or Pro Football Focus (PFF) Grades could be included, but I chose not to use them due to their opaque formulae and potential to double-count certain stats.
